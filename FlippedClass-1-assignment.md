# Flipped Class 1 — Welcome & Instructions

Congratulations on completing your first steps with JavaScript! You’ve explored variables, data types, operators, conditionals, loops, arrays, and objects — plus debugging. Today you’ll put that knowledge into practice with three console‑first mini‑apps. Focus on clean logic and readable console output; UI is optional.

## Getting Started (Workspace + VS Code)
- Create a workspace folder on your computer (e.g., `js-fundamentals-workspace/`) and open it in VS Code.
- Inside that workspace, create a new folder for each assignment you work on.
- In each assignment folder, create `index.html` and `script.js`.
- In `index.html`, include `<script src="script.js"></script>` before the closing `</body>`.
- Install VS Code Live Server: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer
- In VS Code, right‑click `index.html` and choose “Open with Live Server”.
- Keep your browser’s DevTools Console open to view output and errors.

## Order of Assignments
Work through the assignments in this order:

1) Todo & Stats
- Instructions: assignments/flipped-class-1-todo.md
- Build a console‑first todo manager using arrays of objects and core CRUD operations.

2) Gradebook & Analytics
- Instructions: assignments/flipped-class-1-gradebook.md
- Manage students and grades, compute per‑student averages and class‑wide analytics.

3) Expense Tracker & Budget Summary
- Instructions: assignments/flipped-class-1-expense-tracker.md
- Track expenses, totals by category, and monthly summaries; add search and filters.

## How to Work
- Start small: implement one function at a time; test immediately.
- Use `console.log()` to trace values; read error messages carefully.
- Prefer strict equality (`===`/`!==`) and clear, descriptive variable names.
- Keep functions focused; avoid doing too many things in one function.
- Pair up when helpful: explain your thinking; compare outputs and strategies.

## What to Show
- Demo your console outputs for the milestones in each assignment.
- Be ready to explain your data model (arrays/objects) and control flow (if/else, loops).
- If you added optional DOM rendering, show how it reflects your data state.

Have fun, be curious, and lean on your debugging toolkit. If you’re stuck for more than ~10 minutes, add logs, re‑read the instructions, and ask for help.
